### 1 Starting point 

The first version of the algorithm was at a point where it would take well over 12 hours to categorize all 7 dimensional Laplacian matrices. It seems a long way from categorizing all matrices with dimensions in the double-dgits. This version would first generate the set of Laplacian matrices for the given dimension. I quickly realized this may create a memory problem, but would also be problematic as there would be no way to pause the calculation and continue later without repeating many computations.

### 2 Different Approach

The second iteration reorganized the process so that a matrix is generated, controllability is determined, and data is saved before moving on to the next matrix. This allows the program to pause and resume later, giving the potential to break up calculations into many sessions. I also found this algorithm to be must faster. This method categorized all 7 dimensional Laplacian matrices within 3 hours.

### 3 Timing Alogrithm

In the current state (1/31), the algorithm has the following performance:

dim 5: 0.5 sec

dim 6: 30 sec

dim 7: 1.15 hr

dim 8: likely >100 hr

We would love to add efficiency to algorithm so we might be able to process more matrices.

### 4 Algorithm Speed Improvment 

Reorganized and reordered steps PBH Test for more efficient process. This made algorithm about 2x faster. New times: 

dim 5: 0.27 sec

dim 6: 13 sec

dim 7: 28 min

dim 8: ~150 hr
